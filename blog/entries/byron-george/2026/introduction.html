        Hello and welcome to my blog! On this blog I will update the WWW with things I care about, including how bad I
        got beat up in bjj today, my sourdough progress, and if there was any pow on the mountian today (fuck summer).
    </p>
    <p>
        For our first blog, lets get some things strait. This website should look like it was built in the late 90's at
        the absolue <span style="font-style: italic">earliest</span>. <span style="font-style: italic">MINIMAL</span>
        CSS, <span style="font-style: italic">MINIMAL</span> Javascript (although I may throw in a lil live temperature
        of my freezer in there every once in awhile just to show off), and absolutely no coloring (for my big g
        colorblind folks out there).
    </p>
    <p>
        This site will be maintainable, simple, and intutive. We live in America, where most people believe that the
        best way to get healthier is to eat a pill ... well this is ringing the opposite approach to this site. Maybe we
        did peak at HTML. The Internet is about propogating information quickly, and today my timecard took 10 seconds
        to load. Ask yourself ... to send 2816 bits (14*64 bits for each day's entry, 14*32 bits for each date, 128 bits
        for the users id, 32*8 bits for jwt auth, 144 bits for the overhead of an HTTP/1.1 request, plus 1000 more bits
        for things like uri, headers, etc) accross a cable where information travels at the speed of light ... why did
        it take 10 seconds? And why did I have to see an interactive loading screen while I am waiting? Make your app so
        fast you don't need a loading screen.
    </p>

        Less is more, it is a minimalist year, the temperature of my freezer currently is: <font size="3"><span
                class="freezer-temperature"> </span></font> degF.
